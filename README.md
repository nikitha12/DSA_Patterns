# DSA and Design Patterns in Java
This project provides Java implementations of 
- Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) patterns and example question on each pattern
- Design Pattern : Creational, Structural, and Behavioral. Each pattern comes with clear examples to illustrate its usage and benefits.

## DSA Patterns

This section covers implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithmic patterns. 

Each section has easy , medium and hard question from Leet code solved with solution explanination. 

### Array

- Basic array operations (insertion, deletion, search).
- Examples of array-based problems.

## Design Patterns

This section provides implementations of various design patterns categorized by their purpose.

### Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

#### Singleton
- Implementation of different Singleton approaches with examples.
